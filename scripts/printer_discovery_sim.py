Printer Discovery Simulator / Demo (renamed from test_printer_discovery.py)

Usage:
  python3 scripts/printer_discovery_sim.py --scenario home

This thin wrapper calls the original implementation in test_printer_discovery.py
to preserve backwards compatibility while clarifying that this is a demo/simulator,
not a unit test.
