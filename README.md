### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Setup**

Building from source? Follow these steps:

#### 1. Hardware Setup

Build your Scribe Evolution printer following the [Hardware Guide](docs/hardware.md). You'll need:

- ESP32-C3 development board
- CSN-A4L thermal printer
- 3D printed enclosure ([download files](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1577165-project-scribe))
- 5V power supply (2.4A+ recommended)

#### 2. Software Configuration

```bash
# Create your configuration file
cp src/core/config.h.example src/core/config.h

# Edit src/core/config.h with your settings:
# - WiFi credentials
# - MQTT broker (optional)
# - Timezone preferences
```

#### 3. Build and Deploy

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build frontend assets and upload everything
npm run build && pio run --target upload -e main && pio run --target uploadfs -e main
```

#### 4. Build Firmware for Distribution

```bash
# Build clean firmware releases for both board types
npm run firmware
```

### 4. Access Your Printer

- **Local**: http://scribe-[devicename].local or use IP address from boot message
- **Remote**: Configure MQTT for printing from anywhere
