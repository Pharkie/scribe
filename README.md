Your networked ESP32-C3 for thermal printing delights.

![Scribe Thermal Printer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56afd51b-3560-419a-93f4-af315ba2968f)

## Key Features

### Hardware Platform
- **ESP32-C3 support** - Changed from the original project ESP8266 to a more capable ESP32-C3 with hardware serial communication
- **CSN-A4L thermal printer** - Commercial-grade printer with reliable performance

### Network & Remote Capabilities  
- **MQTT remote printing** - Network multiple Scribe printers, print from anywhere
- **mDNS integration** - Access via http://scribe.local or IP address

### Content & Automation
- **Quick fun buttons** - Jokes, quotes, riddles, quiz questions etc
- **Apple Shortcuts support** - Print from anywhere via a HTTP-to-MQTT bridge

### Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive logging** - Multiple output destinations (Serial, file, MQTT, BetterStack)
- **Modular codebase** - Well-organized, documented, and testable architecture  
- **Configuration centralization** - Settings centralised to `src/config.h` then stored to NVS which survive firmware updates, with many user configurable on the front-end.
- **Modern tooling** - PlatformIO, npm build system, automated testing. Not a monolithic Arduino .ino.

## Quick Start

### 1. Hardware Setup
Build your Scribe printer following the [Hardware Guide](docs/hardware.md). You'll need:
- ESP32-C3 development board
- CSN-A4L thermal printer  
- 3D printed enclosure ([download files](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1577165-project-scribe))
- 5V power supply (2.4A+ recommended)

### 2. Software Configuration
```bash
# Create your configuration file
cp src/config.h.example src/config.h

# Edit src/config.h with your settings:
# - WiFi credentials
# - MQTT broker (optional)
# - Timezone preferences
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and upload everything
pio run --target upload_all
```

### 4. Access Your Printer
- **Local**: http://scribe-[devicename].local or use IP address from boot message
- **Remote**: Configure MQTT for printing from anywhere
