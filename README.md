## Quick Start

### 1. Hardware Setup
Build your Scribe printer following the [Hardware Guide](docs/hardware.md). You'll need:
- ESP32-C3 development board
- CSN-A4L thermal printer  
- 3D printed enclosure ([download files](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1577165-project-scribe))
- 5V power supply (2.4A+ recommended)

### 2. Software Configuration
```bash
# Create your configuration file
cp src/config.h.example src/config.h

# Edit src/config.h with your settings:
# - WiFi credentials
# - MQTT broker (optional)
# - Timezone preferences
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and upload everything
pio run --target upload_all
```

### 4. Access Your Printer
- **Local**: http://scribe-[devicename].local or use IP address from boot message
- **Remote**: Configure MQTT for printing from anywhere
