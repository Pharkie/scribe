# Settings Refactor Plan üéØ

**Goal:** Modernize and modularize the settings system without breaking functionality.

**Architecture:**
- Bundling constraints require internal code organization (not external modules)
- Alpine.js patterns with proper stores and reactivity
- Page separation with code duplication until Phase 4 bundling improvements
- Incremental approach with continuous testing

## Phase 1: Build System Modernization ‚ö° ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Replace terser with esbuild for 3x faster builds
- [x] Configure proper bundling with tree-shaking and optimization
- [x] Implement dev/prod file naming: `.js` dev, `.min.js` prod
- [x] Rename vendor ‚Üí alpine for clarity
- [x] Add mock-server debugging support with file mapping
- [x] Remove terser dependency

---

## Phase 2: Internal Organization üèóÔ∏è
*Organize code within existing files, prepare for page separation*

### Step 2.0: Section Separation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Split Device/WiFi sections in current settings
- [x] Create separate `wifi.html` and `device.html` partials
- [x] Update Alpine store for separated sections
- [x] Verify both sections work in monolithic page

### Step 2.1: Utils Structure ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- [x] Create `src/js/settings/utils/` directory
- [x] Basic file structure for future use

### Step 2.2: Internal Utilities ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Extract `showErrorMessage` utility within main store
- [x] Verify internal function extraction works

### Step 2.3: Organize API Functions ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Group API functions within main store by concern
- [x] Add section headers: DEVICE, WIFI, LED, MQTT, SYSTEM/PRINTING, UTILITIES  
- [x] Verify build and functionality preserved

---

## Phase 3: Complete Page Architecture üìÑ
*Create individual pages for each settings section*

### Step 3.1: Create First Page (Device) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create standalone `device.html` page with navigation
- [x] Create focused `page-settings-device.js` Alpine store  
- [x] Copy organized DEVICE CONFIGURATION API functions from main store
- [x] Include UTILITY FUNCTIONS section (showErrorMessage)
- [x] Bundle settings-api with device page (7,145 bytes)
- [x] Update index.html Settings button for testing
- [x] Test complete device functionality: owner, timezone, GPIO pins
- [x] Verify proof of concept for page separation with organized code
- [x] **Testing passed** - Adam manually confirmed Standard Testing Workflow
- [x] **Live ESP32 testing** - Needs Adam to verify on actual hardware

### Step 3.2: Data-Driven Config System: Device Page
**Problem**: Current `/api/config` handler is hardcoded mess - 6 utility functions, manual field mapping, 200+ lines of repetitive validation
**Solution**: Create elegant data-driven configuration system before proceeding to more settings pages
- [x] **Design config field definition system**: Declare fields once with validation rules
- [x] **Create generic validation engine**: Single handler iterates JSON keys, applies rules
- [x] **Eliminate hardcoded field names**: Use reflection/mapping instead of manual switches
- [x] **Consistent partial update pattern**: Any valid key:value updates runtime + NVS automatically
- [x] **Test with device settings page**: Ensure existing functionality preserved
- [x] **Document the pattern**: Clear examples for future settings pages (`docs/DATA_DRIVEN_CONFIG.md`)

### Step 3.3: WiFi Settings Page ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Problem**: WiFi configuration exists in monolithic settings.html with mixed concerns - single file contains all settings sections and JavaScript  
**Solution**: Extract existing WiFi interface (text fields, layout, functionality) from settings-old.html into dedicated `/settings/wifi.html` with separate `page-settings-wifi.js` Alpine store to enable eventual elimination of monolithic settings.html

- [x] **Frontend implementation complete** - Mock server testing passed
- [x] **Live ESP32 testing pending** - Needs Adam to verify on actual hardware

### Step 3.4: MQTT Settings Page ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Frontend implementation complete** - Mock server testing passed
- [x] **Live ESP32 testing complete** - Adam verified on actual hardware
- [x] MQTT connection testing with timeout handling
- [x] Server/port/credentials form with validation
- [x] Enable/disable toggle with connection status feedback
- [x] Red validation warnings and proper Alpine.js reactivity

#### Step 3.4.5: Timezone Picker Enhancement ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- [x] **Frontend implementation complete** - Mock server testing passed
- [x] **Live ESP32 testing complete** - Adam verified on actual hardware
- [x] Searchable timezone picker with 341 IANA timezones
- [x] Format: "City, Country (UTC¬±HH)" with performance optimization

### Step 3.5: Memo Settings ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Frontend implementation complete** - Mock server testing passed
- [x] **Live ESP32 testing complete** - Adam verified on actual hardware
- [x] Memo content editor with placeholder system (date, time, timezone, device owner)
- [x] Individual memo editing and bulk save functionality
- [x] Orange theme with proper dark mode support
- [x] Real-time character counter and validation

### Next Steps: Remaining Settings Pages

**CRITICAL**: Follow established patterns from Device/WiFi/MQTT/Memo pages - DO NOT reinvent solutions

### Step 3.6: Button Settings ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Frontend implementation complete** - Mock server testing passed
- [x] **Live ESP32 testing pending** - Needs Adam to verify on actual hardware
- [x] Button action configuration for 4 hardware buttons
- [x] Short and long press actions with MQTT topics and LED effects
- [x] Hardware configuration display (read-only)
- [x] Indigo theme with proper dark mode support
- [x] **UX improvements**: Grouped Short/Long press sections, MQTT validation, better contrast
- [x] **Icon consistency**: Save button uses checkmark across all settings pages
- [x] **Partial config architecture**: Only sends button-specific fields, not entire config object

**3.7 LED Settings** - Extract LED effect configuration with preview using established patterns  
**3.8 Unbidden Ink** - Extract AI content configuration using established patterns

### Development Patterns for Steps 3.7-3.8 (MANDATORY)

**Follow Existing Refactored Patterns**:
- **HTML Structure**: Copy from `device.html`, `wifi.html`, `mqtt.html`, `memos.html`, `buttons.html`
- **Alpine.js Stores**: Follow `page-settings-*.js` patterns
- **API Integration**: Use `settings-api.js` patterns with `window.SettingsAPI`
- **CSS Themes**: Use established color schemes (accent colour per section)
- **Form Validation**: Use existing validation patterns and error handling
- **Save/Cancel Flow**: Follow exact patterns from existing pages
- **Partial Config Updates**: CRITICAL - Only send relevant config section, not entire config object

**Mandatory Implementation Steps** (DO NOT DEVIATE):
1. **Copy existing HTML structure** - header, form, validation, save buttons
2. **Create Alpine store** following `page-settings-device.js` patterns
3. **Use existing API functions** from `settings-api.js`
4. **Apply colors** consistently with existing pages
5. **Test with mock server first**, then invite and help user to test ESP32
6. **Update settings overview** with new page links

**Success Criteria**:
- Similar user experience to Device/WiFi/MQTT/Memo pages
- Minimise new patterns introduced - reuse existing solutions or ask the user
- Consistent styling, validation, and save flow
- Full functionality extraction from settings-old.html (do not edit or change that reference file or the settings partials)
- Mock server testing passes before ESP32 testing

### Step 3.9: Legacy Cleanup
**Goal**: Remove outdated monolithic files and finalize modular settings architecture
**Status**: Ready to execute - all individual settings pages are complete and functional

**Current State**: ‚úÖ Modular settings architecture complete
- [x] Device Settings - functional with live ESP32 testing
- [x] WiFi Settings - functional with live ESP32 testing  
- [x] MQTT Settings - functional with live ESP32 testing
- [x] Memo Settings - functional with live ESP32 testing
- [x] Button Settings - functional (mock tested, pending live ESP32)
- [x] Navigation complete - clean Home ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Individual Page hierarchy

**Cleanup Tasks**:
- [ ] Remove `settings-old.html` (legacy monolithic file)
- [ ] Clean up unused partials in `/partials/settings/`
- [ ] Verify no broken internal links remain
- [ ] Final end-to-end testing of complete settings workflow

## Phase 4: Build System Optimization üöÄ

**4.0 REST API Pattern Standardization** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] All POST endpoints now consistently follow the correct pattern:
  - **Success**: HTTP 200 + empty body (no JSON parsing)
  - **Error**: Non-200 status + JSON error response (parse for error messages)
- [x] Eliminates JSON parsing errors and creates consistent API behavior
- [x] Content generation endpoints converted from POST to GET (proper REST semantics)
- [x] **Both ESP32 backend AND mock server updated** - full stack consistency
- [x] **Partial Config Pattern**: All settings pages send only relevant config sections, never entire config object

**4.1 Full REST API Compliance** - Convert endpoints to proper HTTP methods:
- **GET** for content generation: `/api/joke`, `/api/riddle`, `/api/quote`, etc. ‚úÖ DONE
- **GET** for reading config: `/api/config` (already correct)
- **PUT** for updating entire config: `/api/config` (currently POST - needs change)
- **PATCH** for partial config updates: `/api/config` (currently POST - consider)
- **POST** for actions only: `/api/print-local`, `/api/print-mqtt`, `/api/setup`
- **DELETE** for resource removal (future possibility)
**4.1 Module System** - Fix esbuild imports, enable code splitting, eliminate duplication
**4.2 CSS Optimization** - Address 60-80KB CSS files, consider gzip compression

### Critical Issue: CSS File Sizes üö®
**Problem**: Tailwind CSS files are 60-80KB each (Tailwind 4.x base size)
**Solution Options**:
1. Single shared CSS build
2. Gzip compression (70% reduction)
3. Manual utility extraction

**Large Resources**:
- `timezones.json`: 174KB
- `riddles.ndjson`: 111KB

---

## Phase 5: Core Pages Refactor üìÑ

**Goal**: Apply proven settings refactor patterns to remaining pages
**Approach**: Use established patterns from Phase 3 settings pages as templates

### Step 5.1: Index Page Refactor
**Current State**: Monolithic `index.html` with embedded Alpine store
**Target**: Modular architecture following settings patterns
- **HTML**: Clean separation of concerns, component-based structure
- **JS**: Extract to `page-index.js` following `page-settings-*.js` patterns  
- **API**: Consolidate API calls using established `*-api.js` patterns
- **Theme**: Maintain existing design while improving code organization

### Step 5.2: Diagnostics Page Refactor  
**Current State**: Functional but should follow established patterns better
Split up from monolithic like settings.html.
**Target**: Align with settings architecture patterns and modularize diagnostic sections

**Sub-phases**:
- **5.2.1 Microcontroller** - Hardware, firmware, memory diagnostics
- **5.2.2 Logging** - System logs
- **5.2.3 Routes** - Pages and API endpoints
- **5.2.4 Runtime Config** - Active configuration display and validation  
- **5.2.5 NVS** - Non-volatile storage (NVS) inspection

**Implementation**:
- **HTML**: Review and align with settings page structure, modularize sections
- **JS**: Ensure `page-diagnostics.js` follows established patterns
- **API**: Standardize API integration patterns  
- **Validation**: Apply settings-style validation and error handling
- **Partials**: Consider extracting diagnostic sections to reusable components

### Step 5.3: 404 Page Refactor
**Current State**: Basic functionality
**Target**: Polish and align with overall architecture
- **HTML**: Consistent styling and structure
- **JS**: Minimal but following patterns where applicable
- **UX**: Improve navigation and user guidance

### Step 5.4: Documentation & Templates
- [ ] Document proven patterns from settings and core page refactors  
- [ ] Create reusable templates for future page development
- [ ] Establish coding standards and architectural guidelines

## Process üõ†Ô∏è

### Process
**Standard Workflow**: Create page ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Mock test ‚Üí Live ESP32 test ‚Üí Update plan ‚Üí Commit

### Development Patterns
- **Alpine.js**: Use @input handlers for immediate changes, keep Alpine.effect() simple
- **CSS**: Tailwind utilities directly in HTML, support light/dark mode, avoid semantic abstractions
- **Forms**: Save button enabled only when changes detected
- **Testing**: Mock server ‚Üí Live ESP32 verification

### CSS Requirements
- Use Tailwind utility classes directly in HTML (not semantic abstractions like `.btn`)
- Support light/dark mode with `dark:` prefixes
- Only use `@apply` for genuine duplication or complex webkit patterns
- Keep styling visible in templates

## Core Principles
- **One step at a time** - Complete fully before proceeding
- **Ask user** to confirm any major deviations or major decisions before proceeding. Caution. Safety first.
- **Keep old code functional** - Main settings.html works throughout
- **Alpine.js patterns only** - No hacks, use built-in reactivity
- **Fail fast** - No fallback values, let Alpine handle missing data
- **Test everything** - Every endpoint, form, validation
- **Live device testing** - Required at end of each phase for hardware-dependent features

### Project Success Criteria
- All settings functionality identical to current (settings-old.html)
- Code more maintainable and modular
- No regressions in UX, only improvements.
- ESP32 memory usage unchanged


## Lessons Learned üìù

**Alpine.js Patterns:**
- Use built-in reactivity (`x-effect`, `$nextTick`) not custom solutions
- Use @input handlers for immediate form changes, not complex watchers
- Keep Alpine.effect() simple and focused on high-level state changes
- **Dark mode**: Use Tailwind classes `dark:` not inline styles (timezone dropdown fix pattern)

**ESP32 Constraints:**
- file.readString() fails on large files - use chunked reading for >8KB
- Work within buffer constraints - separate endpoints better than large JSON
- Don't overcomplicate native ESP32 functionality (WiFi scanning) - it worked before
- Single WiFi radio means scanning affects connection - let ESP32 handle natively
- MQTT TLS: Racing connections cause socket conflicts - use connection guard and recreate WiFiClientSecure

**Configuration Management:**
- Centralized config loading prevents inconsistencies - all settings use RuntimeConfig
- Maintain parallel versions during major architectural changes

## Rejected Ideas üö´

**Partial Config GET Endpoints** - Creating `/api/config/device`, `/api/config/wifi` etc. for reading config sections. Over-engineering: full config JSON isn't large enough to warrant splitting, adds maintenance burden and memory overhead on ESP32. (Note: partial writes via POST `/api/config` already work fine.)

## Live ESP32 Testing Status üîß

**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Step 3.1: Device Settings**
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Step 3.3: WiFi Settings** 
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Step 3.4: MQTT Settings**
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Step 3.4.5: Timezone Picker**
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Step 3.5: Memo Settings**

All completed settings pages have been verified on live ESP32 hardware.

---

## Rejected Ideas üö´

### Partial Config API Endpoints (3.3 - rejected)
**Problem**: Each settings page needs only its section of config, not full config blob
**Proposed Solution**: Add `/api/config/device`, `/api/config/wifi`, etc. endpoints
**Rejection Reasons**:
- Over-engineering: Full config JSON isn't large enough to warrant optimization
- Memory overhead: Each new endpoint adds routes/handlers on ESP32 with limited resources
- Maintenance burden: 6+ new endpoints to maintain, test, and keep in sync  
- Breaking risk: More complexity = more ways for things to break
**Alternative**: Keep existing `/api/config`, let pages ignore unneeded sections client-side
